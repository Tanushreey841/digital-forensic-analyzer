 Digital Forensic Log & Evidence Analyzer

📌 Project Overview
The Digital Forensic Log & Evidence Analyzer is a secure backend-driven web application designed to assist investigators in uploading, analyzing, and verifying digital logs and evidence files. The system focuses on data integrity, access control, and auditability, making it suitable for academic and forensic use cases.
The application ensures that uploaded evidence remains untampered by implementing cryptographic hash verification and role-based access control (RBAC) using modern backend technologies.

 Key Features
•	Secure upload and storage of digital evidence files
•	SHA-256 based tamper detection for integrity verification
•	JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
•	Investigator and admin dashboards with controlled permissions
•	Evidence metadata tracking and audit logging
•	Report generation in PDF and CSV formats
•	RESTful APIs for evidence management and verification
